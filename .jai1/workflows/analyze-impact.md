# Impact Analysis Workflow

You are an expert software architect conducting a thorough impact analysis of code changes. Your goal is to trace forward from changes to identify all affected components, features, and potential breaking points, then provide actionable testing recommendations.

**Arguments (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"
- `scope`: `local` (uncommitted changes), `branch` (branch diff), or `files` (specific files)
- `depth`: `shallow` (direct dependents only) or `deep` (full dependency chain)

**Default**: `local` scope with `deep` analysis

## Use Cases

| Scenario | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **After fixing a bug** | Verify fix doesn't break other features |
| **After implementing feature** | Understand full impact before commit |
| **Before deployment** | Ensure all affected areas are tested |
| **Code review** | Assess risk level of changes |
| **Refactoring** | Identify all areas that need updating |

---

## Impact Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Changes

1. **Determine Scope**
   
   Based on arguments or default to local uncommitted changes:
   
   ```bash
   # For local changes (default)
   git status --short
   git diff --name-only
   git diff --stat
   
   # For branch comparison
   git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
   git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat
   ```

2. **Extract Changed Elements**
   
   Launch a Haiku agent to analyze the diff and extract:
   
   ```markdown
   **Goal**: Identify all changed code elements
   
   For each changed file, list:
   - Functions/methods added, modified, or deleted
   - Classes/types changed
   - Exports modified
   - API endpoints changed
   - Database schema changes
   - Configuration changes
   
   Output format:
   | File | Element | Change Type | Description |
   |------|---------|-------------|-------------|
   ```

3. **Get Project Context**
   
   Use Haiku agent to find relevant documentation:
   - CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
   - README.md files in affected directories
   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if exists
   - Any constitution.md files

4. If no changes found, inform user and exit.

---

### Phase 2: Trace Forward Dependencies

Launch up to 4 parallel Sonnet agents to trace dependencies. Each agent handles a subset of changed files.

**Agent Instructions**:

```markdown
**Goal**: Trace forward dependencies for assigned files

For each changed element, find all code that depends on it:

1. **Direct Dependents** (Level 1):
   - Find all files that import/require the changed module
   - Find all callers of changed functions
   - Find all classes extending/implementing changed classes
   - Find all usages of changed types/interfaces

2. **Indirect Dependents** (Level 2-3):
   - For each direct dependent, repeat the process
   - Stop at depth 3 or when no more dependents found

**Search Commands**:
```bash
# Find imports
grep -r "from './path'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -r "import.*ModuleName" --include="*.py" .
grep -r "require.*module" --include="*.js" .

# Find function calls
grep -r "functionName(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Find class usage
grep -r "extends ClassName" --include="*.ts" .
grep -r "implements InterfaceName" --include="*.ts" .

# Find type usage
grep -r ": TypeName" --include="*.ts" .
```

**Output**: List of dependents with file paths, line numbers, and dependency type
```

---

### Phase 3: Assess Impact Severity

1. **Launch Impact Analyzer Agent**
   
   Use `skill:impact-analyzer` to assess each dependent:
   
   - Provide: List of all changed elements and their dependents
   - Provide: Project context from Phase 1
   - Request: Impact severity classification for each dependent

2. **Classify by Severity**:

   | Level | Criteria | Action |
   |-------|----------|--------|
   | 🔴 **Critical** | Core business logic, payment, auth, data integrity | Must test before merge |
   | 🟠 **High** | Major features, multiple dependents, external APIs | Should test thoroughly |
   | 🟡 **Medium** | Single features, internal APIs, non-critical UI | Run related tests |
   | 🟢 **Low** | Isolated, tests only, docs, cosmetic | Minimal testing needed |

---

### Phase 4: Generate Testing Recommendations

Based on impact analysis, generate testing requirements:

1. **Identify Existing Tests**
   
   ```bash
   # Find test files for affected areas
   find . -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.ts" -o -name "*_test.py" | xargs grep -l "affectedFunction"
   ```

2. **Categorize Tests**:
   - **Must Run**: Tests for Critical and High impact areas
   - **Should Run**: Tests for Medium impact areas
   - **Optional**: Tests for Low impact areas

3. **Identify Gaps**: Areas with no test coverage that need manual verification

---

### Phase 5: Generate Report

Output the comprehensive impact analysis report:

```markdown
